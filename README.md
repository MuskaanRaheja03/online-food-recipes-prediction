#  End-to-End Data Science Project: Online Food Recipes

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes online food recipes using data science techniques to uncover key patterns in ingredients and predict cuisine types. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and business insights.

##  Key Features

- Thorough EDA to understand ingredient usage and distribution
- Predictive modeling using classification algorithms
- Visualizations to support insights
- Clear business recommendations

##  Files

- `End_to_End_Online_Food_Recipes.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code and analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

##  Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
